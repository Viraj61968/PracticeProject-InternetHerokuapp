		 	or side of the screen while you scroll through the page. They are commonly used for navigation, contact options, 
		 	or important CTAs (Call-To-Actions).
		 
		 Reason to Test Floating Window - 
		 1. Ensure the menu remains visible and functional as the user scrolls through the page.
		 2. Confirm the menu doesnâ€™t obstruct important content or interfere with readability.

		 method to validate if the element is click able or not. 
		 2. The reason I've printed out the current URL is because that is the only way to validate it, which you can see in the console
		 that after it has click on the floating window the name of the menu is shown in the URL. like here it is " #home ".
